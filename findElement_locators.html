First matching element
Many locators will match multiple elements on the page. The singular find element method will return a reference to the first element found within a given context.

Evaluating entire DOM
When the find element method is called on the driver instance, it returns a reference to the first element in the DOM that matches with the provided locator. This value can be stored and used for future element actions. In our example HTML above, there are two elements that have a class name of “tomatoes” so this method will return the element in the “vegetables” list.

<const vegetable = await driver.findElement(By.className('tomatoes'));
  
Evaluating a subset of the DOM
Rather than finding a unique locator in the entire DOM, it is often useful to narrow the search to the scope of another located element. In the above example there are two elements with a class name of “tomatoes” and it is a little more challenging to get the reference for the second one.

One solution is to locate an element with a unique attribute that is an ancestor of the desired element and not an ancestor of the undesired element, then call find element on that object:
<const fruits = await driver.findElement(By.id('fruits'));
<const fruit = fruits.findElement(By.className('tomatoes'));

Optimized locator
A nested lookup might not be the most effective location strategy since it requires two separate commands to be issued to the browser.

To improve the performance slightly, we can use either CSS or XPath to find this element in a single command.
<const fruit = await driver.findElement(By.css('#fruits .tomatoes'));
  
Tips on working with locators
preferable us to use unique id then use CSS or XPath to locate elements.
<const fruit = await driver.findElement(By.css('#fruits .tomatoes'));

All matching elements
There are several use cases for needing to get references to all elements that match a locator, rather than just the first one. The plural find elements methods return a collection of element references. If there are no matches, an empty list is returned. In this case, references to all fruits and vegetable list items will be returned in a collection.
<const plants = await driver.findElements(By.tagName('li'));
  
Traditional Locators
Selenium provides support for these 8 traditional location strategies in WebDriver:

Locator	Description
class name-	Locates elements whose class name contains the search value (compound class names are not permitted)
css selector-	Locates elements matching a CSS selector
id-	Locates elements whose ID attribute matches the search value
name-	Locates elements whose NAME attribute matches the search value
link text-	Locates anchor elements whose visible text matches the search value
partial link- text	Locates anchor elements whose visible text contains the search value. If multiple elements are matching, only the first one will be selected.
tag name-	Locates elements whose tag name matches the search value
xpath-	Locates elements matching an XPath expression
